## Description

This is a front end task from Yosemite Labs.

I use `https://pokeapi.co/` API for all the info displayed and use in this app.

I used `NextJS with Typescript` to develop it since React is the requirement and `ChakraUI` for the UI framework.

## How to run in your localhost environment

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnebab/yosemite-pokemons.git
```

Second, change directory to the the `/yosemite-pokemons` folder then run:

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
